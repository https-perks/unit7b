          <h2>Log #586 – Administrative Action: Agent Ember</h2>
          <h3>Report by Director Pines</h3>
          <p>
            This log serves as formal documentation of today’s disciplinary review of Agent Ember, following her latest
            spree of, as I am told, “helpful” field logs (see Logs #561–585, and honestly, most entries marked ‘Ember’
            this quarter).<br><br>

            Summary of incident: At approximately 11:08 am, the administrative desk received its 17th notification of
            the day that “Agent Ember has posted a new log.” Upon review, these logs included such critical intelligence
            as: Ember attempting to negotiate with bison, Ember losing socks in geysers, Ember blending in with the
            lost-and-found at Lake Hotel, Ember drawing an entire notebook full of “Syndicate logos” (for the record,
            one was just a badly-drawn raccoon with sunglasses), and Ember adopting a spoon from the Yellowstone River,
            believing it to be “field equipment.”<br><br>

            After careful consideration (and several deep breaths), I summoned Agent Ember to my office (again). The
            following points were addressed:
          <ul>
            <li>Logs must pertain to actual field phenomena, not the agent’s lost-and-found adventures.</li>
            <li>Feeding census forms to bison is not an approved survey technique.</li>
            <li>Blending in with the lost-and-found is neither a field tactic nor an appropriate use of agent time.</li>
            <li>Not every “found” spoon is a potential coded message from the Syndicate.</li>
            <li>Grape jelly is not a substitute for hand soap. (Nor is it an acceptable field ration.)</li>
            <li>Attempting to check in a raccoon as a hotel guest, even if he “requests extra towels,” is not protocol.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Agent Ember has been assigned to remedial log-writing training (led by Agent Soot, who has, somewhat
          dubiously, volunteered to help). She is required to submit logs only when an incident involves actual,
          verifiable phenomena—no more logs about her own “field mishaps,” or at the very least, she is instructed to
          redact her own name when responsible for the mishap.<br><br>

          Personal note: For the record, reviewing Ember’s logs has become a daily exercise in self-control and
          facepalming. While the administrative team appreciates her enthusiasm, future logs will be monitored for
          relevance, brevity, and a minimum threshold of actual usefulness.<br><br>

          Final administrative action: Agent Ember will retain field status under probation, with all logs subject to
          review and possible immediate archiving (or shredding).<br><br>

          <h2>Log #587 – Response to Administrative Action</h2>
          <h3>Filed by Agent Ember</h3>
          <p>
            In response to Director Pines’ very formal (and slightly dramatic?) disciplinary action, I would like to
            clarify a few points:<br><br>

            1. The raccoon absolutely requested extra towels. <br>
            2. That spoon felt important. I stand by my field intuition.<br>
            3. Bison respond surprisingly well to census forms (though they did eat pages 3–7).<br>
            4. I will try to keep future logs strictly “phenomenological.” Unless a pinecone tells me otherwise.<br><br>

            As instructed, I am attaching my official apology letter. It may be slightly pinecone-themed, as required by
            my creative process.

          <p>
            Dear Director Pines,<br><br>

            I, Agent Ember, hereby issue my sincerest apologies for any confusion, distraction, or unnecessary paperwork
            caused by my recent flurry of logs (and for the jam incident in the North Gate restroom; I thought it was
            hand soap).<br><br>

            Please accept this drawing of a pinecone wearing sunglasses (see below) as a gesture of goodwill and my
            promise to only submit field logs that meet the highest Unit 7-B standards:<br><br>

            </span>
            <br><br>
            I vow to channel my boundless curiosity into logs that are useful, accurate, and (occasionally) less about
            spoons and raccoons. Thank you for the feedback and for not reassigning me to Raccoon Surveillance Duty
            (again).<br><br>

          <h3>Filed by Junior Agent Rook (training Agent Ember)</h3>
          <p>
            Ember used field binoculars correctly and reported sighting of mule deer.<br>
            No equipment lost, traded, or “adopted.”<br>
            Recommend mild celebration.

            Training report: Agent Ember completed log entry using only observable facts.<br>
            No pinecones, raccoons, or commentary on hand soap.<br>
            As her supervising agent, I approve this log (and suggest we call it a day before she finds another spoon).

            Observed strange ripples on the river at 8:23 am. At first, I thought it was just wind, but then the ripples
            formed a pattern that looked like the Unit 7-B sigil… or maybe a squirrel?<br><br>
            I tried to get a photo for evidence, but my phone battery died exactly as I pressed the button. Threw a
            pinecone in the water to see what would happen (for science).<br><br>
            The pinecone floated, which I believe is significant. No other agents present to confirm. If someone finds
            my notebook (it may have gone in the river), please return it to lost-and-found.<br><br>
